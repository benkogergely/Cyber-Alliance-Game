# Cyber Alliance Game

## Brief summary

The following code is created for the Cyber Alliance Game to generate visualizations. For its implementation, we used the NumPy, NashPy, and Python Image Library libraries. By proceeding linearly in the code, we first set the rewards and penalties, then run the code. Generating a specific visualization takes a few minutes.
